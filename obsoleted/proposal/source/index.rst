OpenPPL: A Proposal for Probabilistic Programming in Julia
===========================================================

This document proposes the design of *OpenPPL*, an open source probabilistic programming framework implemented as a domain-specific language on top of Julia. This document discusses the design of basic language constructs for model specification, query, as well as directives to control algorithmic choices in inference.
